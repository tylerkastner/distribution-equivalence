# Distributional Model Equivalence for Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning


Code to reproduce the experiments illustrated in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01708).


Our experiments are split into either tabular experiments, or experiments in an option trading domain. The code for each set of experiments can be found in the ``tabular`` and ``option_trading`` directories respectively.
